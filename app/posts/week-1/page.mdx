  <summary className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 text-[15px] mb-2">Majority: Server Components</summary>

    Most of the time, I fetch data in a Server Component (like a `page` or `layout`). Occasionally, I'll still use an external library for client-fetches (e.g. `swr`) when working with existing codebases.

    ```jsx
    export default async function Page() {
      let data = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog')
      let posts = await data.json()
      return (
        <ul>
          {posts.map((post) => (
            <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )
    }
    ```
